    *   *ngFor Directive :

            1. ngFor is usually used to display an array of items
            2. Since ngFor is a structutal directive it is prefixed with *
            3. *ngFor='let employee of employees' - In this example 'employee' is called template 
               input variable, which can be accessed by the 4. [tr] element and any of it's child elements.
            5. ngIf structural directive displays the row "No employees to display" when employees 
               property does not exist or when there are ZERO employees in the array.
     
   *    *ngIf Directive:

            1. The * prefix before a directive indicates, it is a structural directive
            2. The ngIf directive conditionally adds or removes content from the DOM based on whether or not
               an expression is true or false.
            3. ngIf structural directive displays the row "No employees to display" when employees 
               property does not exist or when there are ZERO employees in the array.

   *    Using trackyBy with ngFor directive : 

            1. ngFor directive may perform poorly with large lists.
            2. A small change to the list like, adding a new item or removing an existing item may trigger 
               a cascade of DOM manipulations like employee list manipulation.

            3. At the moment we are not using trackBy with ngFor directive
            4. When the page initially loads we see the 4 employees
            5. When we click "Refresh Employees" button we see the fifth employee as well
            6. It looks like it just added the additional row for the fifth employee. 
               That's not true, it effectively teared down all the <tr> and <td> elements of all the 
               employees and recreated them.
            7. To prove this launch browser developer tools by pressing F12.
            8. Click on the "Elements" tab and expand the <table> and then <tbody> elements
            9. At this point click the "Refresh Emplyees" button and you will notice all the <tr\> elements 
               are briefly highlighted indicating they are teared down and recreated.

            This happens because Angular by defualt keeps track of objects using the object references. 
            When we click the "Refresh Employees" button we get different object references and as a result 
            Angular has no choice but to tear down all the old DOM elements and insert the new DOM elements.

            Angular can avoid this churn with trackBy. The trackBy function takes the index and the current 
            item as arguments and returns the unique identifier by which that item should be tracked. 
            
    *   How to get the index of an item in a collection:

                let i = index;      ...index is the property which we can use in ngFor
                let isLast = last   ... returns last element of list
                likewise we have first, even, odd properties.
            Please see demo for these properties and refer ngFor in above code.

    *   Angular Pipes : Pipes in Angular
            1. Transform data before display.
            2. Built in pipes include lowercase, uppercase, decimal, date, percent, currency etc
            3. To apply a pipe on a bound property use the pipe character " | "
            {{employee.code | uppercase}}

        We can also chain pipes: Ex.
            {{employee.dateOfBirth | date:'fullDate' | uppercase }}
        Pass parameters to pipe using colon " : "
            {{employee.annualSalary | currency:'USD':true:'1.3-3'}}   
            {{employee.dateOfBirth | date:'fullDate'}}
            {{employee.dateOfBirth | date:'dd/MM/y'}}
            
        In Currency pipes above -
            1. The first parameter is the currencyCode . i.e. USD
            2. The second parameter is boolean - True to display currency symbol, false to display currency code
            3. The third parameter ('1.3-3') specifies the number of integer and fractional digits

        We can also create custom pipes.

    *   Creating Custom Pipes:
            Ex. Here is what we want to do. Depending on the gender of the employee, we want to display 
                Mr. or Miss. prefixed to the employee name.
        

        Step 1 : To achieve this let's create a custom pipe called employeeTitlePipe. 
                 Right click on the "employee" folder and add a new TypeScript file. 
                 Name it "employeeTitle.pipe.ts". Refer this file for code.
            
                1. Import Pipe decorator and PipeTransform interface from Angular core
                2. Notice "EmployeeTitlePipe" class is decorated with Pipe decorator to make it an Angular pipe
                3. name property of the pipe decorator is set to employeeTitle. This name can then be used 
                   on any HTML page where you want this pipe functionality.
                4. EmployeeTitlePipe class implements the PipeTransform interface. 
                   This interface has one method transform() which needs to be implemented.
                5. Notice the transform method has 2 parameters. value parameter will receive the name of 
                   the employee and gender parameter receives the gender of the employee. The method returns 
                   a string i.e Mr. or Miss. prefixed to the name of the employee depending on their gender.

       Step 2 : Register "EmployeeTitlePipe" in the angular module where we need it. 
                In our case we need it in the root module. 
                So in app.module.ts file, import the EmployeeTitlePipe and include it in the "declarations" 
                array of NgModule decorator. 
                For this refer app.module.ts file

       Step 3 : In "employeeList.component.html" use the "EmployeeTitlePipe" as shown below. 
                Notice we are passing employee gender as an argument for the gender parameter
                of our custom pipe. Employee name gets passed automatically as first parameter.
                employee.name | employeeTitle:employee.gender
