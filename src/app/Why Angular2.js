Why Angular 2 ?

    *   Angular 2 is completely rewritten.

    *   Performace: 
            * Angular 2 is 5 times faster than Angular 1.
            * Improved Modularity.
            * Dependency Injection
            * Testability.

    *   Mobile Support: 
            * With Angular 2 we can built a single application that works across mobile and desktop 
              devices.
            * Angular 1 was not built for mobile support. It is possible to build mobile application 
              using angular 1 but with using third party libraries.
            * Angular 2 is build by keeping in mind the mobile support.

    *   Componenet based Development: 
            * In Angular 2 everything is a Component.
            * Componenets are the building blocks of Angular2 application. It facilitates greater 
              code reusability.
            * Unit testing is more easy and tastable in angular2 because of components.

    *   More Language Choices -
            * ES5, ES6
            * TypeScript
            * Dart
            * PureScript
            * Elm etc..
        We can use any of above language to build angular2 application.
        TypeScript is the most popular amonst above languages.

        Angular2 is build using TypeScript itself.
